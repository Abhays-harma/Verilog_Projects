Introduction
"Hello, I'd like to explain a Traffic Light Controller project that I worked on using Verilog. This project simulates the behavior of traffic lights at an intersection, controlling two sets of lightsâ€”one for each road."

High-Level Overview
"The Traffic Light Controller manages the lights to ensure safe and efficient traffic flow. Each set of traffic lights has three states: Red, Yellow, and Green. The controller uses a finite state machine to cycle through these states based on a clock signal and sensor inputs."

Inputs and Outputs
"The main components of the project include:

Inputs:
clk: A clock signal that drives the state transitions.
Sa: A sensor signal for road A to detect the presence of vehicles.
Sb: A sensor signal for road B to detect the presence of vehicles.
Outputs:
Ra, Rb: Red lights for roads A and B.
Ga, Gb: Green lights for roads A and B.
Ya, Yb: Yellow lights for roads A and B."
State Machine
"The core logic of the traffic light controller is implemented using a finite state machine (FSM). The FSM transitions through various states based on the clock signal and the sensor inputs."

States and Transitions
"The states represent the different light configurations:

States 0 to 4: Road A has a green light, and Road B has a red light. These states increment with each clock cycle.
State 5: Road A remains green, and Road B remains red. If the sensor Sb detects a vehicle, the state transitions to 6.
State 6: Road A switches to yellow, and Road B remains red.
States 7 to 10: Road A turns red, and Road B turns green. These states increment with each clock cycle.
State 11: Road A remains red, and Road B remains green. If the sensor Sa detects a vehicle or if no vehicle is detected on road B, the state transitions to 12.
State 12: Road A remains red, and Road B turns yellow. The next state is 0, starting the cycle again."
Light Assignment
"Based on the current state, the outputs for the traffic lights (Ra, Rb, Ga, Gb, Ya, Yb) are set using temporary registers. These registers hold the light values for each road during each state."

Timing and Synchronization
"The state transitions occur at the positive edge of the clock signal. This ensures that the traffic lights change in a synchronized manner, maintaining safe and orderly traffic flow."

Summary
"In summary, the Traffic Light Controller project uses a finite state machine to manage the red, yellow, and green lights for two roads at an intersection. It takes sensor inputs to detect the presence of vehicles and uses a clock signal to drive the state transitions, ensuring safe and efficient traffic management."
